# EmojiPaster
Allows you to paste popular emojis as though you typed the alt code for them.

Click any button and that button's text will be placed on your clipboard. The buttons on the bottom work as follows:

The left button '<' is a back space for the center button.
The center bottom button is a string of the previously pressed emojis which when clicked will paste onto your clipboard.
The right button '`_`' is a space for building long strings

Right clicking on the center button will delete everything in there.

This will only work if the font you are pasting into supports that emoji. I personally recommend symbola as it displays the most.
